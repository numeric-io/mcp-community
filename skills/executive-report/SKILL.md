# Executive Report

Generate a board-ready or CFO-ready financial statement from Numeric. Strip all close management
metadata, collapse child account detail into executive summary groups, roll up flux commentary
into concise narratives, and output a presentation-quality Excel or PDF artifact.

This skill produces a **presentation artifact** — not a data export and not a close management
view. The output should be indistinguishable from something a CFO would hand to the board.

---

## Step 0: Clarify before building

Ask the user (or infer from context):

1. **Workspace** — which Numeric workspace?
2. **Period** — which month/quarter? (single period or comparison?)
3. **Entity scope** — single entity, or multi-entity (consolidated or per-entity sheets)?
4. **Output format** — Excel (.xlsx) or PDF?
5. **Comparison** — prior month, prior quarter, prior year, budget vs. actual, or none?

If the user says "just make it" without specifying, default to: single entity, current period
vs. prior month, Excel output. Confirm the defaults before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: Pull source data

GL data must be pulled through this ordering. Do not skip steps. `build_report` is unreliable
and is treated as a last resort.

1. **Call `list_reports` first.** Find IS and BS configs (and any consolidated or per-entity variants).
2. **Use `get_report_data(configuration_id, period_id)` for each matching saved report.** If multiple
   plausibly match, show the user the top 2–3 and let them pick — do not silently pick.
3. **Only fall back to `build_report` when no saved config can serve the need.** Tell the user you
   are doing so and why.
4. **Validate the `build_report` response.** If it returns no data rows, or rows where every balance
   is zero/null, stop. Do not produce a partial executive report.
5. **On `build_report` failure, ask the user.** Show them the saved configs from step 1 and ask which
   to use instead, or ask for explicit instruction (different period, different entity,
   manually-specified report ID, abort).

Other calls used in this step:

```
get_workspace_context       → entity list, period IDs, gl_connection_id
list_financial_accounts     → chart of accounts for group mapping
list_tasks(period_id, task_type="flux")  → flux tasks for commentary rollup
```

For multi-period comparisons, pull each period's report data separately.

For multi-entity (consolidated): try `list_reports` first for a consolidated saved config or for
per-entity IS/BS saved configs to aggregate. Only fall back to `build_report` per entity
with `pivots: ["account", "org"]` if no saved configs cover the entities. Flag to the user if
intercompany elimination is needed — do not silently net intercompany unless the user confirms it.
If `build_report` returns empty for any entity, halt the consolidation and ask the user how to
proceed (pick a saved config instead, drop that entity, or abort).

---

## Step 2: Collapse to executive groups

Strip all child account detail. Collapse the full chart of accounts into these standard
executive statement groups:

### Income Statement groups

| Group | What it includes |
|---|---|
| Revenue | All revenue accounts — subscription, license, services, other revenue |
| Cost of Revenue | All COGS accounts — hosting, support, direct labor, merchant fees |
| **Gross Profit** | Revenue − Cost of Revenue *(computed)* |
| R&D | All R&D / engineering / product development expense |
| Sales & Marketing | All S&M / marketing / customer acquisition expense |
| General & Administrative | All G&A / corporate / finance / legal / HR expense |
| **Total Operating Expenses** | Sum of R&D + S&M + G&A *(computed)* |
| **Operating Income (Loss)** | Gross Profit − Total OpEx *(computed)* |
| Other Income / (Expense) | Interest income, interest expense, FX gains/losses, other non-operating |
| Income Tax | Tax provision |
| **Net Income (Loss)** | Operating Income + Other Income − Tax *(computed)* |

### Balance Sheet groups (if requested)

| Group | What it includes |
|---|---|
| Cash & Equivalents | All cash and short-term investment accounts |
| Accounts Receivable | Trade receivables and unbilled revenue |
| Other Current Assets | Prepaid, inventory, deposits, other current |
| **Total Current Assets** | *(computed)* |
| Fixed Assets, net | PP&E net of accumulated depreciation |
| Intangibles & Other | Capitalized software, goodwill, other long-term assets |
| **Total Assets** | *(computed)* |
| Accounts Payable | Trade payables |
| Accrued Liabilities | Accrued expenses, accrued compensation |
| Deferred Revenue | Current deferred revenue |
| Other Current Liabilities | Other short-term obligations |
| **Total Current Liabilities** | *(computed)* |
| Long-term Debt | Term loans, notes payable, non-current borrowings |
| Other Long-term Liabilities | Non-current deferred revenue, lease obligations, other |
| **Total Liabilities** | *(computed)* |
| Total Equity | Paid-in capital + retained earnings + accumulated OCI |
| **Total Liabilities & Equity** | *(computed)* |

### Group mapping logic

Use `list_financial_accounts` to map each account to its executive group:

1. Use the account's `category` / `type` field as the primary signal (REVENUE, COGS, EXPENSE, ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY)
2. Use the account name and parent path to distinguish OpEx sub-groups (R&D vs. S&M vs. G&A)
3. If an account doesn't clearly map, assign it to the nearest logical group and note it in
   the "Account Mapping Notes" section at the bottom of the output
4. Never drop an account silently — every dollar must land somewhere

Sum all accounts within each group to produce the group-level balance.

---

## Step 3: Roll up flux commentary

For each IS group that has a material variance (>5% or >$10K vs. comparison period):

1. Call `list_tasks` with `task_type="flux"` and the target `period_id`
2. For each flux task that maps to this group's accounts, call `get_task_comments` to pull
   the preparer's explanation
3. Synthesize child-level explanations into a single concise narrative (1–2 sentences max):
   - Lead with direction and magnitude at the group level: "R&D up 12%"
   - Attribute to 2–3 specific drivers: "driven by 3 new hires in Feb ($45K) and
     increased AWS usage ($18K)"
   - If no flux commentary exists for a group, omit the narrative rather than fabricating one

**Good narrative**: "Sales & Marketing up 23% ($341K) driven by Q1 campaign spend ($180K)
and 2 new SDR hires ($95K salary + benefits)."

**Bad narrative**: "Sales & Marketing expenses increased compared to the prior period."

Place the narrative as a note row directly below the group line in the output.

---

## Step 4: Detect currency and brand

### Currency

For each entity, detect the reporting currency:
1. Check `organization_currency` on GL transaction lines via `query_transaction_lines` (sample 1 line)
2. Fall back to `currency_code` on accounts from `list_financial_accounts`
3. Default to USD ($) if undetectable — note the assumption to the user

Apply the correct symbol: USD = $, EUR = €, GBP = £, CAD = C$, AUD = A$, etc.

### Brand styling

Use Numeric's brand palette throughout. This report is a Numeric-generated artifact and should look like one.

| Element | Color | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Header bar background | `#1F0045` | Deep navy-purple — full-width title row |
| Header text | `#FFFFFF` | White bold, 13pt |
| Section header rows (Revenue, COGS, R&D…) | `#1F0045` | White bold text |
| Subtotal rows (Gross Profit, Operating Income…) | `#EEEEEF` | Lavender-gray fill, `#1F0045` bold text |
| Net Income row | `#1F0045` | White bold text, double underline |
| Metric/ratio rows (Gross Margin %, EBITDA…) | `#F0EBFF` | Light violet fill, `#7036FF` italic text |
| Commentary narrative rows | `#F7F7FB` | Very light lavender, `#4D4D5B` italic 9pt |
| Positive variance | `#12B76A` | Numeric green |
| Negative / unfavorable variance | `#E53935` | Numeric red |
| Accent / progress fills | `#7036FF` | Numeric violet |
| Page background (PDF) | `#F7F7FB` | Light lavender-white |
| Body text | `#1F0045` | Primary dark navy |
| Secondary / muted text | `#778CA2` | Used for column headers, labels |

Font: Arial throughout. No other fonts.

## Step 5: Build the output

### Financial statement formatting rules

Apply these rules consistently across both IS and BS output:

**Hierarchy and indentation:**
- Group headers (Revenue, Cost of Revenue, R&D, etc.): bold, no indent, left-aligned
- Computed subtotals (Gross Profit, Operating Income, Net Income): bold, no indent
- Commentary narrative rows: italic, gray font (`#666666`), indented 1 level, 9pt

**Borders:**
- Single underline above subtotal rows (Gross Profit, Total OpEx, Operating Income)
- Double underline above and below Net Income (Loss)
- No borders on regular data rows

**Number formatting:**
- All monetary values: currency symbol + scale shorthand
  - ≥ $1M: display as `$X.XM` (e.g., `$66.0M`, `$(3.2M)`)
  - ≥ $1K: display as `$X.XK` (e.g., `$341.3K`)
  - < $1K: display as `$XXX`
- Negative values: parentheses, never minus sign — `(3,241)` not `-3,241`
- Percentage columns (variance %): `0.0%` format, red font if unfavorable
- Variance $ column: same scale shorthand, red font if unfavorable
- Zero balances: display as `—` (em dash), not `$0` or `$0.0M`

**Column layout (IS):**
```
| Account Group | [Period] | [Comparison Period] | Variance $ | Variance % | Commentary |
```

**Column layout (BS):**
```
| Account Group | [Period] | [Prior Period] | Change $ | Change % |
```

**Gross Margin line:**
Add a Gross Margin % row directly below Gross Profit:
`Gross Margin: XX.X%` — displayed inline, italic, indented

**EBITDA block:**
After Net Income, add a reconciliation block:
- Operating Income (Loss)
- + Depreciation & Amortization
- = **EBITDA**
- EBITDA Margin: XX.X%

### Multi-entity handling

**Consolidated view:**
- Sum all entities into a single column
- Add an "Entities included" note in the header
- If the user flags intercompany balances, add an "Intercompany Eliminations" row between
  entity subtotals and the consolidated total — but only if the user confirms the IC amounts

**Per-entity view:**
- One sheet per entity, named by entity name (not ID)
- Add a "Summary" sheet with all entities side by side for comparison

### Excel implementation (openpyxl)

```python
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment, Border, Side

# Numeric palette
NAVY       = "1F0045"
VIOLET     = "7036FF"
LAVENDER   = "EEEEEF"
LT_VIOLET  = "F0EBFF"
LT_BG      = "F7F7FB"
GREEN      = "12B76A"
RED        = "E53935"
MUTED      = "778CA2"
SECONDARY  = "4D4D5B"

HEADER_FILL    = PatternFill("solid", fgColor=NAVY)
SECTION_FILL   = PatternFill("solid", fgColor=NAVY)
SUBTOTAL_FILL  = PatternFill("solid", fgColor="EEEEEF")
NETINC_FILL    = PatternFill("solid", fgColor=NAVY)
METRIC_FILL    = PatternFill("solid", fgColor="F0EBFF")
COMMENT_FILL   = PatternFill("solid", fgColor="F7F7FB")

HEADER_FONT    = Font(name="Arial", bold=True, color="FFFFFF", size=13)
SECTION_FONT   = Font(name="Arial", bold=True, color="FFFFFF", size=10)
SUBTOTAL_FONT  = Font(name="Arial", bold=True, color=NAVY, size=10)
NETINC_FONT    = Font(name="Arial", bold=True, color="FFFFFF", size=10)
METRIC_FONT    = Font(name="Arial", italic=True, color=VIOLET, size=10)
COMMENT_FONT   = Font(name="Arial", italic=True, color=SECONDARY, size=9)
DATA_FONT      = Font(name="Arial", color=NAVY, size=10)
LABEL_FONT     = Font(name="Arial", color=MUTED, size=9)

POS_VAR_FONT   = Font(name="Arial", color=GREEN, size=10)
NEG_VAR_FONT   = Font(name="Arial", color=RED, size=10)
```

- **Header bar**: rows 1–2 merged across all columns. Row 1 = Numeric wordmark + report title. Row 2 = entity name, period, generated date. `HEADER_FILL` background, `HEADER_FONT` text.
- **Column widths**: A = 44 (labels), data columns = 16, variance % = 10, commentary = 52
- **Row heights**: header rows = 28, section rows = 18, commentary rows = 26 (wrap_text=True)
- **Freeze panes**: B3
- **No gridlines**: `ws.sheet_view.showGridLines = False`
- **Tab color**: `1F0045`
- **Account Mapping Notes** at the bottom: `LABEL_FONT`, 9pt, `LT_BG` fill

### PDF output

If the user requests PDF:
1. Build the Excel workbook first (Step 5 above)
2. Convert to PDF using LibreOffice headless:
   ```bash
   libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp/ /tmp/output.xlsx
   ```
3. Verify the PDF was created and is non-empty
4. Deliver the PDF; optionally also offer the Excel source

---

## Step 6: Deliver

Save to the outputs folder:
- Excel: `{WorkspaceName}_Executive_Report_{Period}.xlsx`
- PDF: `{WorkspaceName}_Executive_Report_{Period}.pdf`

Provide a brief inline summary alongside the file link:
- Revenue, Gross Margin %, Operating Income, Net Income for the period
- Top 1–2 variance drivers if flux commentary was available
- Note any accounts that couldn't be mapped or any assumptions made

Keep the summary to 3–5 lines. The document is the deliverable.

---

## Performance

Fan out per entity in the multi-entity branch, run `scripts/collapse_to_groups.py` inside each subagent, confirm comparison period upfront, and checkpoint per entity. See `references/performance.md` for the full pattern.

**Always pass `--report-config` to `collapse_to_groups.py`.** Save the relevant entry from `list_reports` to a JSON file and pass its path. The script uses it to detect non-account-pivoted reports (e.g., expense-by-vendor IS) and refuse to run with exit code 3 — preventing silent wrong totals from leaf-id collisions in the COA. Example invocation:

```bash
python3 scripts/collapse_to_groups.py \
  --report report_data.tsv \
  --coa coa.json \
  --statement is \
  --report-config report_config.json \
  --out collapsed.json
```

If the script exits with code 3, surface the message to the user, ask them to pick a different saved report whose deepest pivot is `account.external_id`, and re-run. Only pass `--allow-non-account-pivot` after the user confirms the leaf pivot's IDs are interchangeable with account external_ids in the COA (rare).

## Edge cases

- **No flux commentary available**: skip the narrative rows entirely — don't generate
  fabricated commentary. Note to the user that flux explanations weren't found.
- **Accounts that span multiple groups**: assign to the primary group based on account name.
  Note the assignment in Account Mapping Notes.
- **Prior period has no data**: show the current period column only. Mark comparison columns
  as "N/A — no prior period data."
- **Negative Gross Profit**: flag explicitly with a note: "Gross margin is negative this period."
- **PDF conversion failure**: deliver the Excel and note that PDF conversion failed. Suggest
  the user open and print-to-PDF manually.
- **Multi-currency entities in a consolidated view**: do not silently mix currencies. Ask the
  user which currency to consolidate into and what FX rate to apply (spot, average, or
  user-provided).
